#Path to the entities Genus and GenusNote:
#LoadFixtures.php, Fixtures::Load will invoke 
#new Genus() and new GenusNote() and so on
#and store them into the db
#
#in mysql delete recods in tables with:
#> delete from "tablename"
#
#after schema changes you have to drop tables:
#> drop table "tablename"
#
#because of foreign key constraints (relationships of entities)
#you must start to delete with the children (foreign key entities)
#> delete from genus_notes, drop table genus_notes
#> delete from genus, drop table genus
#< delete from sub_family, drop table sub_family
